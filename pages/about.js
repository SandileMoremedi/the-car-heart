          Hi, I&apos;m Sandile Moremedi. I&apos;m a freelance website developer.
          I had interests in cars since I was a young kid like most of the males
          on earth. I haven&apos;t drove a car yet at the age of 20.
          Disappointing.
          <br />I always had this gut feeling that one day I&apos;m gonna own my
          own Toyota Supra, Nissan 370z or Mitsubishi Evo, just to name some of
          my dream cars.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite never driving a car, I was always and still am keen on knowing
          everything that&apos;s inside a car. By inside I mean every piece of
          of a car, from the steering wheel to the fly wheel, from the spring to
          the piston, to the way the engine works.
        </p>

        <p>
          So with all the skills I have, I decided to make a website where I can
          share all the things I learn about a car, and also make it accessible
          to everyone including you. You can write your own blog, you can check
          out our car gallery and as time goes there will be more features for
          everyone. So enjoy and feel home, this content is to be used by you to
          your heart&apos;s desire.
