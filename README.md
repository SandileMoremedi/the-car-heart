# The Car Heart

This is a personal project by Sandile Moremedi.
The reason I made this was both for my personal interests and to add a big project in my portfolio.

## Websites' Functionality and Technologies

The technologies I used were challenging seeing that I was/am a junior developer.

<ul>
    <li>
    NextJS - The reason I used NextJS was because of it's easy layout and functionality. It's easy to use and with my experience with ReactJS, it was helpful.
    </li>
    <li>
    MongoDB - MongoDB is my second go to database technology. The reason I picked this for the project is because I was trying to get used to it. I had only little experience with it. So it was a chance for me to learn it.
    </li>
    <li>
    Framer Motion - I needed a way of transitioning from one page to another without losing the interest of the user and to add a bit of cool details. I didn't use much but I believe it was enough.
    </li>
    <li>
    SASS - I am very familiar with SASS, more than any UI library. Because of that I needed the challenge of having to use CSS without any library.
    </li>

</ul>
